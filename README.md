> Minimal Firefox user.js tweaked for privacy
```

![My Firefox setup](assets/home.png)

Firefox is a [mess](https://polarhive.ml/blog/firefox/). This repository
contains my configs & tweaks that you can use on Firefox-based browsers.
I think Mozilla should ship with these tweaks pre-configured.

## Like LibreWolf?

Vanilla Firefox can be tweaked to do everything that [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)
already does. You don't need to use LibreWolf if you use my ``user.js`` file.

Most GNU/Linux distros ship with better; up-to-date versions of Firefox.
LibreWolf is built only after Mozilla releases the next build of Firefox.
Some-distros specifically patch their distro's release to improve performance
and have desktop [integrations](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/linux/-/issues/232)
like KDE Plasma.

Most importantly â€” you get official support from Mozilla, should top-sites
stop working because of [Chromium](https://webcompat.com/) incompatibilities.
LibreWolf might feel too-harsh for some people when popular sites stop-working.
You should be using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) if your
goal is to improve your digital-privacy and combat fingerpriting.

[Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/), or pick a [Searx](https://searx.me/) instance.

## Extensions & Themes

I use these for a better web-browsing experience. I'd say installing uBlock origin is the least
one can do these days. Checkout the other extensions or install your own. Make sure your
extensions aren't proprietary as these can be potenial security-risks.

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) - ads/content blocker
- [LocalCDN](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/localcdn-fork-of-decentraleyes/) - fetch fonts, JS libraries locally instead of remote CDNs
- [libredirect](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/libredirect/) - helps you use privacy frontends like Nitter, Piped & Teddit
- [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) - dark-mode for sites that don't have a dark theme
- [nicedark-theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nicedarktheme/) - what it says on the tin: a 'really nice' dark-theme
- [materialocean-theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/material-ocean-theme/) - the colorscheme that I use

> TIP: HTTPS is always on. You don't need to install any extension. Check this [page](https://codeberg.org/polarhive/vulpes.rss) for furthur updates.
